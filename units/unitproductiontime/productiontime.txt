In S1914 the tech level is the factory level.

Factory levels are available at day8 (lvl1), day10 (lvl2), day 12 (lvl 3) and day 14 (lvl 4).

Once the first segment of factory is completed the workshops gets deleted. (if you add the workshop later manually as admin, the production bonuses get stacked)

check:
do productiontimes still update when a new factory level has been completed (by hitpoint)? Seems to be the case, but server response can be very long. many minutes?

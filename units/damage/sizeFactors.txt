This system of size Factors will be removed by the new (COW) combat system.

For all units, except infantry, it is the case that land attack damage equals building attack damage.

Infantry applies 75% of land atk damage.

Morale units like infantry and cavalry usually donâ€™t have 100% morale, while 50% of the damage is factored by morale. The graph displays 100% morale units. (They start out with the current morale of the province they are produced/generated in)
